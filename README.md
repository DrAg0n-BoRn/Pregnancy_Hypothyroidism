# Identifying Key Factors in Pregnancy Complications Among Hypothyroid Women: A Deep Learning Approach

## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Maternal thyroid dysfunction is a significant risk factor for adverse obstetric outcomes, yet specific predictors for complications in hypothyroid pregnancies remain underdefined. This study evaluates the efficacy of Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE)—a deep learning architecture specifically designed for tabular data—to predict Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM), Fetal Macrosomia, and Meconium Stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF). We analyzed a nine-year longitudinal dataset of anonymized hospital records, utilizing Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and Random Undersampling to ensure data quality and balance. The deep learning models demonstrated robust performance, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.81 for PROM, 0.82 for macrosomia, and 0.70 for MSAF, with high recall rates ranging from 0.79 to 0.84. Interpretability analysis via Integrated Gradients identified thyroid peroxidase antibodies as predominant predictors for PROM and MSAF, whereas maternal weight and fetal biometrics were critical for macrosomia. These findings highlight the superior utility of deep learning for early risk screening and suggest a potential systemic link between thyroid autoimmunity and specific pregnancy complications.
